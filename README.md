In Java, LinkedList is a part of the collection framework provided in java.util package. LinkedList is a linear data structure where all the elements are unsorted in contiguous memory locations. The advantage of LinkedList is it is dynamic and easy to insert and delete any element. We can not access any node of LinkedList directly we need to start with the Head node and traverse through a LinkedList.

Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. If we use Comparable then it will affect the original class. Comparable Interface provides compareTo() method to sort elements. In java, comparable is provided by the java.lang package. We can sort the LinkedList by invoking the Collections.sort(List) method. 

LinkedList can be sorted in the following order using Comparable:

Ascending Order
Descending Order
Using Collections.reverseOrder()
Override the CompareTo() method
